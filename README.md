# ✋ Hand Gesture Volume Control 🔊

This project allows you to control the system's **volume** using hand gestures! By using the **MediaPipe** library for hand detection, **OpenCV** for video capture, and **Pycaw** for controlling the system's audio, the program adjusts the volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger. 🤖🎶
